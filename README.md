You now realize that the [elevator you took](http://ifiction.org/games/) now
reads **B2** on the display. As the elevator slows down you hear a loud
metallic screeching sound. The elevator doors start to open, but stop halfway.
As you pry the doors open, cobwebs and dust blur your vision for a few moments.

As you gain your orientation, you catch in the corner of your eye that there is
a shiny object ahead. As you walk closer to the shiny object, you make out that
it is an engraved sign that reads:

> What you did yesterday can be improved today.
