You now realize that the [elevator you took](http://ifiction.org/games/) now
reads **B2** on the display. As the elevator slows down there is a loud
metallic screeching sound. The elevator doors start to open, but stop halfway.
The only thing to do is pry the doors open. 

Cobwebs and dust blur your vision for a few moments; arms flailing trying to
prevent the dust and cobwebs to get in your eyes.

Dazed and confued you start gaining orientation and see a shiny object that
shimmers just beyond the cobwebs that hang in front of the elevator doors that
are still not fully open.

Taking a few steps fowrard  to the shiny object, you make out that
it is an silver engraved sign that reads:

> What you did yesterday can be improved today.
