    read_state    returns a flag specifying if the games wants a 
                string a single char on next execution.

    save_game    returns sting to be used to resume game.
                *NOTE*
                Do not get this until you printed the screen out
                (frotz_output) It will break if a 'more'
                prompt is expected.

    beeps        returns an int that specifies how many times the game
                beeped.


frotz_play
  int frotz_play(string command)

  Uses the string command to issue a set of commands to a game. A value
  of 0 will be returned if another command can legally be played for the 
  next round.

  Note that no eol (\n) is needed to be appended to the command string. 
  In fact it will cause  false key stokes be submitted to the game.

  Depending on your configuration you may need to issue a strip slashes. 

  Special keys can be passed to the game by escaping them with '\'. 

    \d   represents a <key-down>
    \u   represents a <key-up>
    \l   represents a <key-left>
    \r   represents a <key-right>


frotz_output
  void frotz_output(int type)

  Print the results of a played game.
  Type can be:
  
    FROTZ_PRINT_PRE  (default) prints out html inside a <pre> tag.
    FROTZ_PRINT_DUMP will printout all possible data (more prompts). Used
                     primarily for debugging.

frotz_close
  int frotz_close(void)

  Must be called. Just keeps you outa trouble!
